## Hey there!

I'm currently a high school junior (graduating in 2026) using the moniker CountBleck.

* **Interests**: *WebAssembly*, web dev; to a lesser extent, cryptography as well
* **Location**: Los Angeles, CA

I contribute on occasion to [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).
I sometimes work on other stuff, but it's usually unfinished and/or private.

(TODO: adding more information here!)
