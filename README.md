## Hey there!

I'm currently a high school senior (graduating in 2026) using the moniker CountBleck.

* **Interests**: *WebAssembly*, web dev; cryptography as well (but I need a better math background!)
* **Location**: Los Angeles, CA

I contribute on occasion to [AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript).
I sometimes work on other stuff, but it's usually unfinished and/or private (or PRs to other open-source projects, in which case a little digging through my GitHub history should locate them).

(TODO: adding more information here!)
